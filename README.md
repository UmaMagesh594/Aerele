# Inventory Management (Flask)

Simple Flask app for tracking products across locations with movement logs and a balance report.


Notes
    • Uses SQLite for demo. To use MySQL, change SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI in app.py.
    • Add seed data by creating Products and Locations, then add Movements. ```
